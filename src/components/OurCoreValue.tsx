      <h3>utual Respect</h3>
         Mutual respect is the bedrock of any healthy relationship and serves as a fundamental pillar of humane and ethical behavior. It entails deeply valuing an individual's right to exist, be heard, and enjoy equal opportunities as others. Respect extends beyond overlooking or merely tolerating differences; instead, it encompasses the recognition of these differences, understanding their significance, and responding with genuine interest, politeness, and care.

      <h3>Social Justice</h3>
       We believe in fairness and equality in the distribution of mental health resources and services. This value is rooted in the idea that everyone should have access to the care they need regardless of their financial status or other factors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Diversity</h3>
          We are committed to upholding diversity and inclusiveness in our hiring and promotion processes, ensuring that every individual has equal access to opportunities and advancement within our company.</p>
